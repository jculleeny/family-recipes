                    Me and my two friends like to have nights where we get together, make a good meal, and watch a movie.
                    The meal is usually made by me with help from them in the prep. I decided to make a web site to share
                    some of those recipes and meals online. It's more of a personal site of the things I enjoy cooking, but 
                    is a nice tie in with the good memories of those nights.
